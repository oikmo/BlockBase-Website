							<h1>About the game</h1>
							BlockBase is developed by <a href="https://github.com/Oikmo">Oikmo</a>. It originally started in June 28 2023 where it was shortly
							abandoned until March 20th 2024 where it would be worked on from then to now.
							<p>You can read the <a href="/credits.php">full credits here</a>, or read about <a href="/support.php">support and frequently asked questions here</a>.
							<br><br>
							</p><h3>Origins</h3> 
							Everyone knows Minecraft. If you haven't then I don't really know how else to say to you but
							you are literally living under a rock. Anyways, it was just a "hey what if I can make my own
							update or version of Minecraft?" and I was already sort of adjusted to the language of Java
							and I wanted to try something different rather than <a href="https://github.com/oikmo/not_found">not_found</a>. 
							I came back to it in 2024 after suffering from burnout from <a href="https://github.com/ManiaticDevs/PepDog">PepDog</a> 
							and just having that passion for making a voxel game.<br>
							</p><h3>Development</h3>
							Honestly, it has been a pain in the ass to develop. Seriously, there would be some random bug that just wouldn't go away
							and I would have just redo the entire thing or just remove what is causing it. In Alpha 0.1.9, it was the worst. My friends
							kept consistently finding new bugs everytime and I would have to go back and re-release that version and then do it again.
							<br><br>
							Other than that I actually enjoy working on it! I would just randomly find myself doing something random or fixing a bug
							within the project. Everytime I would be bored in a lesson I would just randomly ask my friends for ideas or more splash texts.
							<br><br>
							Oh yeah by the way, did you know that the splash texts were actually all from my friends? Yeah! I just gave them on requirement,
							it just had to be some form of English and also it can be anything.
							<h3>The future</h3>
							I just wanna work on BlockBase until it's... actually... I'm not sure. I just want to add features to it I guess.
							But for now, the plan is to make as close to the classic/alpha version of minecraft then start making it different
							in style. (see the multiplayer aspect in which other players have obsidian heads)
							<br><br>
							However, I do want to make it possible for modding and all that!<br><br>
							As for this website I hope to add custom skins.
